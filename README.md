# dotfiles
My dotfiles.
Not that good with scripting so the install script is very simple. The install script doesn't overwrite any current configurations.

.zshrc and .xinitrc are not installed via the install script. Simply put these two files in your home directory.

The color scheme for my configs are based around "catppuccin". Check out there [github](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin)

Fonts to install:
"ttf-feather"
"ttf-jetbrains-mono"
