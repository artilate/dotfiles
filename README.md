# dotfiles
My dotfiles.
Not that good with scripting so the install script is very simple.

.zshrc and .xinitrc are not installed via the install script. Simply put these two files in your home directory.

The color scheme for my configs are all based around "catppuccin". Check out there [github](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin)
