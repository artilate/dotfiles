# nvim-config
This is my first neovim configuration so expect it to be filled with issues and lots of mistakes. So far, it has only been tested Linux and an older version has been working on Windows.

When you put the configuration into your nvim config location, run "PlugInstall"

You will also need to have node installed as well as a cc, gcc, etc.
 
Make sure when everything is done to run ":checkhealth"
